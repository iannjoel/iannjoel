 What better way to tell a digital story than telling a story you know best, your own. I want to make an interactive portfolio that introduces every interesting facet of my being from <b> who I am, what I do, my interests, my responsibilities, and most importantly, the skills I have learned </b> and picked up throughout the years to be as appealing to employers as possible and for you to get to know me better.
 </br> 

<br> I envisioned my interactive portfolio to be fashioned after a magazine filled with pictures I take of myself, supplemented by text and related images. And as you scroll through it transitions into the next frame introducing more facts about myself. I envision the tone to be a true reflection of my humor, self-deprecating and a lot of side thoughts.
</br>

<br>The frames will be divided into several parts that will showcase my skills in layout and motion. First, by introducing <b> who I am, my major, my school, my current work, and what I plan to do in the future, presently. </b>
</br>

<br>I’m considering an option where a viewer has a choice on a dropdown menu on what journey or frames they are interested in pursuing. It will have tabs such as: <b>work, interests, my dreams.</b> If the viewer continues on without clicking a specific tab, the story will flow organically.
</br>


<br>I’m considering a <b> video component </b> here or an interactive guide that walks the viewer through.
</br>

<br>First, it will introduce myself as a multi-faceted designer that specializes in <b> creative advertising, marketing, and user-centered design. </b>
</br>

<br>I will include the principles that I highly value as a creative person such as: <b>excellence, legacy… </b> values that I incorporate into every work I put out as a part of my personal brand. Maybe include my <b> strengths, weaknesses, and skills </b> I plan to acquire.
</br>


<br>In the <b> work tab </b> it will show my best works in graphic design, branding, web design, UX/UI, and motion graphics. It will be supplemented with succinct texts to describe my work and my reasonings and logic to the creative direction and output. The option of looking through each work will also be available for the viewer. </br>

<br>I can supplement the work tab with my <b>work history, background, and experience </b> working in marketing, graphic design, and e-commerce, with more detail that I can’t achieve in a single page resume.
<br>

<br>In the <b> interests tab</b> it will show my interest in dressing up, writing fashion blogs, modeling, or my passion working for fashion brands or celebrities. Also, what I do in my free time and maybe anecdotes of how that interest or hobby came to be.</br>

<br>In the <b> vision section</b> it will show what my 10 year vision will look like or what I aspire to achieve in the future. It will serve as a reminder what making it in life looks like.</br>

<br>I want to include things that I am learning about myself such as <b> self-love, finding a purpose, and trusting the timing of my life. </b> And give my own advice and do a self-reflection on what I learned or progress. </br>

<br><b><span>Hire me!</span></b></a></br>
